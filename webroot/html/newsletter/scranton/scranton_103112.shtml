<div style="margin-left:12px;margin-right:12px;">The hardest part of my job is having to say no. But hey, someone's gotta lay down the law. That's right, I'm talking about costume approval. I take Halloween super serious. Love the 'ween! In fact when I was in college, all anyone would talk about was how much the Nard Dog loved 'ween. Sure it's got the tricks and the treats but the costume is the key to a spooktacular experience. You want an easy approval from old Andy Boo-nard? Then follow these tips.<br><br>

Be original! Sure we all know the standards. Zombie. Vampire. Marty McFly from Back To The Future. But try something new. Excite me. Try some mixin' and matchin'. How about werewolf Marty McFly? (Which BTDubs is not to be confused with Teen Wolf.) The possibilities are endless!<br><br>

No repeats! Don't want to see a million Banes this year. And I don't want to see you in the same costume every year. Angela, just because your cat has 9 lives, doesn't mean you can wear that costume 9 times.<br><br>

Detail! It's the little things are going to make the difference between knowing whether you're Snooki or an Oompa Loompa. Everyone knows Oompa Loompas aren't as orange. Zing!<br><br>

Timeliness! No more Sarah Palins!<br><br>

Don't be too obscure! If people can't figure out what you are, then what's the fun? When I went as the Big Red Bear a couple years ago, it was really a bummer. Can't get in the mood with all the people asking me if I was Yogi or Fozzie or Smokey. Learned my lesson that year. Barely had any fun.<br><br>

Backstory! You can't judge a 50 Shades of Grey costume by its cover! (Also please no 50 Shades of Grey). Think of it like a Miss America pageant. Everyone's got the look but you got to bring the personality to make a lasting impression. Commit to the part. Really dig deep and flesh out the character. And do your research! Nothing worse than a Katniss Everdeen who doesn't even know how to shoot a bow.<br><br>

And above all else, remember this. You can be sexy-spooky. You can be spooky-funny. You can even be sexy-funny. But you can't be sexy-spooky-funny. Unless you're Elvira. Which, Meredith, you can not be. Can't emphasize that enough. (Also see timeliness tip above.)<br><br>

Okay Boos and Ghouls! Time to wrap this mummy up! Happy Halloween!<br><br>

<div style="margin-left:12px;margin-right:12px;">October is over, which means one thing, pre-Christmas season is in full swing. If you're like me, you finished your preliminary shopping and grocery scout in August, but for those of you who might be a touch behind, here are a few tips.<br><br>

One: Don't Panic. You've still got time to put together a decent holiday celebration for your family. Will it be as good as it could have been had you prepared earlier? Obviously not, but realizing your limitations will help curb any unrealistic expectations you and your family might have. Not everyone can have the perfect Christmas, but if you want to see what it looks like, feel free to stop by my house any time in between Thanksgiving and Christmas. By appointment only. No walk-ins. <br><br>

Two: Compromise. This year the Senator and I are having a great debate over which placemats we should use on our dining room table. He wants to use the holly and wreath placemats for Christmas Eve Dinner when it is obvious we should use the classic red placemats to draw full attention to our 28-piece nativity scene in the middle of the table. We only have two months to decide. As with every Christmas season, it's going to come down to the wire, but learning to live with our opposing worldviews is part of what makes our marriage work.<br><br>

Lastly, the most important tip I can give you is delegate. You can't be expected to baste the turkey, make homemade eggnog, and be the energetic host of the Christmas party all at the same time, so put those aunts, sisters-in-law, and grandmas to work. As long as people are in your house, you will get the credit. Do you think Walt Disney ever operated Space Mountain? He did not, but when you go to Disney World, there is one name who becomes synonymous with that park. That's what I hope to do with Christmas some day, when people think of the birth of Jesus I want them to think of one person: Angela Martin-Lipton. Have a Merry Christmas!<br></div>

So as it turns out, our office has a newsletter. Since I'm the new guy here, I was "volunteered" to write an article. Seeing as my other option for the afternoon is answering angry complaint calls, I think I'll give this a shot.<br><br> 

I've started bringing my lunch to work. So far, it usually only takes until about 11:30 before Stanley eats it. I don't know if this is the place to do this, but Stanley, do you mind not eating my lunch anymore? No big deal but I would appreciate it.<br><br>

I've almost made enough money from this job to buy a new dresser. Right now I just keep my clothes in two laundry baskets, one for clean, one for dirty. Probably not the best system. Also I own six dress shirts now. Something I'm sadly quite proud of.<br><br> 

If anyone wants to sponsor my friend's kickball team, we still need a $200 pledge to cover league dues and uniforms. Your name would be on the jersey of course. We could be the Fighting Merediths or Halpert's Heroes?<br><br>

Well I guess that's it from back here in the annex. I'm going to go back to fielding all the complaints coming in about you from your customers.</div>

I just want to give a quick update on Operation Giveback.  I'm very pleased to report that we had 100% participation from the Dunder Mifflin staff.  Originally, I thought Dwight Schrute might be the only hold-out, but after watching the film "127 Hours," we both agreed that he could designate his portion of the charitable funds to an outfit that makes prosthetic devices available to any poor person who gets caught in a rock and must cut their own arm off.  It's a small group, granted, but they're a very grateful group.  My next "special project" will be to come up with a Halloween costume that will "wow" them at the office. My first inclination is to dress up as one of my co-workers (but sexy, of course).... perhaps Sexy Pam... or maybe Sexy Toby...  ooh, I get chills just thinking about it. <br>
